Project: Running a hotel business

I assume that the project will probably receive and change information about employees and guests, same way
regulate access to rooms, floors. Regulate the normal work of employees, their salary, status, etc.
Regulate time that hotel guests spend at hotel and the opportunities that their status allows (for example,
access to the dining room, swimming pool or hotel gym or club).
